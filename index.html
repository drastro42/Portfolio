        <h2>RULES EXPLANATION</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The rules sheet describes all the major things that a new player will need to know to start playing. Simply read out the text written on this sheet to the group, or let those who want to read it do so privately.</p>

            <div class="italic">
                <p><i>Part of the rules sheet will prompt you to talk about various hand signals. You’ll want to demonstrate these hand signals as you go, since some players learn visually.</i></p>

                <p><i>If you wish, you can read out the part of the rules sheet that talks about nominations and executions now, but most players will learn this better if you read it out later on, when the first nomination for execution begins.</i></p>

            <h3>BEFORE THE GAME STARTS</h3>
            <p>
                A long time ago in the sleepy town of Ravenswood Bluff, during a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight... you hear a scream. Rushing to the Town Square to investigate, you find your beloved Storyteller, myself, has been murdered... impaled on the hour hand of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. You assume that this is the work of a Demon, and you are correct—a Demon that kills by night and takes on human form by day.

You are about to receive either a red or blue token. If blue, you are good. If red, you are evil. The aim of the game if you are good is to find and execute the Demon. If the Demon dies, good wins. The aim of the game if you are evil is to destroy the town. If just two players are left alive, evil wins.

            </br>The game is split into two phases: a day phase and a night phase. During the day, you talk. You will each have a secret identity, a character on the list. Generally, the good players share whatever they know and attempt to find out who is who. Most good players will be telling the truth, but some have an incentive to lie. If you are evil, you should definitely be lying! It is best to pick a good character to pretend to be, spreading as much false information as possible.

        </br>During the night, everybody closes their eyes. I will wake some players so that they can use their ability or gain some type of information. At night, I will be silent, but communicate using the following signals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 taps on your shoulder or your knee means EYES OPEN</li>
                <li>This means EYES CLOSED</li>
                <li>This means YES and this means NO</li>
                <li>This means GOOD and this means EVIL</li>
                <li>This means 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on</li>
                <li>To choose a player at night, just point to them like THIS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most of you will die. This is a good thing! In Ravenswood Bluff, death is not the end. Some players may even want to die, as they gain information when they do. If you are dead, you still participate in the game, you may still talk, and you still win or lose when your team wins or loses.

                </br>There is a lot of information in this game. However, some of it might be wrong. If you are drunk or poisoned, you have no ability, but I will pretend that you do. I am allowed to lie to you—any information that you get may be incorrect, but you will not know if you are drunk or poisoned. For example, if you are the Drunk, you drew a different character token out of the bag and only I know that you are actually the Drunk. Or, if the Poisoner poisons you, you may still wake at night to use your ability, but it won’t work. </br>

            <h3>FOUR RULES</h3>
            <p> This can be a lot of information to take in at once, so to keep things simple, there are only four things you need to remember:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>You may say whatever you want at any time</li>
               <li>No peeking</li>
               <li>Ask me questions if you need to (Gamemaster)</li>
               <li>Play nice</li>
            </ol>
